    <h2>Why Teenagers Desperately Need Better Sleep</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>üåô The Problem</h3>
        <p>Teens need 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night but most only get around 6. That builds up a serious sleep debt. Your internal clock gets thrown off, your brain‚Äôs sleep center (the hypothalamus) malfunctions, and your energy, focus, and mood take a hit.</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that nearly 3 out of 4 high school students do not get enough sleep on school nights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>üß† Brain and Body</h3>
        <p><strong>Memory and Focus</strong><br>
        Your brain organizes memories and locks in learning during REM sleep. Without it, studying becomes nearly pointless. The National Institutes of Health explains that teens who sleep well concentrate better and perform stronger academically.</p>

        <p><strong>Mood and Stress</strong><br>
        Sleep loss increases cortisol, the stress hormone. That leads to anxiety, anger, and mood swings. Harvard Medical School links poor sleep to higher rates of depression, especially in teenagers.</p>

        <p><strong>Growth and Immunity</strong><br>
        Your body produces growth hormone and repairs muscles during deep sleep. If you miss out, your immune system weakens and healing slows down. The Sleep Foundation says deep sleep helps restore the body and strengthens defenses against illness.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>üåç Society and Culture</h3>
        <p>Sleep habits among teenagers are not just personal choices‚Äîthey are shaped by society, culture, and school systems. Understanding these influences can help us fix the real problem.</p>

        <p><strong>üìä Cross National Sleep Patterns</strong><br>
        Recent studies show big differences in how much teens sleep in different countries:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Country</th>
                <th>Average Teen Sleep</th>
                <th>Key Factors</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>South Korea</td>
                <td>7 hours 21 minutes</td>
                <td>High academic pressure, after school classes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spain</td>
                <td>8 hours 1 minute</td>
                <td>Late social schedules, family habits</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>United Kingdom</td>
                <td>8 hours 46 minutes</td>
                <td>Later school start times, better awareness</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>üß† Why Culture Matters</strong><br>
        In places like South Korea, academic success is seen as super important so teens stay up late to study. This causes chronic sleep loss. In Spain, people usually eat and socialize later which also delays bedtime. But in the UK, schools start later and there are national programs teaching the importance of sleep. That helps teens rest better and feel healthier.</p>

        <h3>üí° What You Can Do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stick to a schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day</li>
            <li>Limit screens: No phones or tablets an hour before bed (blue light blocks melatonin)</li>
            <li>Cut caffeine: Avoid coffee, tea, or soda after 3 PM</li>
            <li>Create a cool dark quiet room: Use blackout curtains or a fan</li>
            <li>Push for later school times: Talk to your teachers or principal</li>
        </ul>
